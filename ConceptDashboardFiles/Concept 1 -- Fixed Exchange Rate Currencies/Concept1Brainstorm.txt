- Goal is to create a dashboard component that shows you all the global currencies on an interactive geographical map (maybe heat map).
- You can click on different countries and see which country's currencies are pegged to it / pegged to
    - You can then select countries and see a historical plot of their exchange rates to look for consistency 


Steps:

1) Data Collection
    a) Goal is to create some dataframe that shows all the countires, and lists the countries they're pegged too
    b) Find a link... Looks like two wikipedia articles are our best options:
        1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_circulating_currencies
        2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_circulating_fixed_exchange_rate_currencies
